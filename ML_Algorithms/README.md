### Machine Learning Algorithms

Each notebook is an explanation and implementation of a common machine learning algorithm. The algorithms covered include:
- K-Means Clustering
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Trees, including Boosted and Random Forests
- Support Vecor Machines
- (Deep) Neural Networks
